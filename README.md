# css-design-system
A personal CSS design system defining layout, spacing, typography, and color tokens for building consistent, scalable web interfaces.


## Overview

This repository contains a reusable CSS design system that acts as the foundation for all my frontend projects.

It defines:
- Global reset rules
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Layout structure using `.page`, `.section`, and `.container`
- Consistent spacing and sizing rules
- Scalable and maintainable CSS architecture

The goal is to eliminate ad-hoc styling and ensure visual consistency across projects.

## Philosophy

- Single source of truth using CSS variables
- Predictable layout hierarchy
- Mobile-first and responsive by default
- No framework dependency
- Works with React, Django templates, or plain HTML
